CWAC Cache: Dealing With Pesky Download Times
=============================================

Many Android applications need to download stuff off of the
Internet, particularly Web assets like feeds and images. This
module contains a lightweight cache implementation, in the
form of an abstract class (`AsyncCache`) and one concrete
cache (`WebImageCache`).

As the name suggests, `AsyncCache` is designed for the case where
what you want might not already be available, either in RAM
(held in a `Map` with `SoftReference`s) or on disk (in a cache
directory of your choosing). In that case, you get handed
back some stub object (e.g., a placeholder image), while the
cache busily downloads what you need in the background.
Courtesy of integration with the [CWAC Bus module][bus], you
can be notified when the background download is complete, so
you can take appropriate action (e.g., replace the thumbnail).

`WebImageCache` is simply an `AsyncCache` that knows how to download
and cache images off the Web.

Usage
-----
Full instructions for using this module are forthcoming. Stay
tuned!

Dependencies
------------
This project requires the [CWAC Task module][task] and the
[CWAC Bus module][bus]. A copy of
compatible JARs can be found in the `libs/` directory of
the project, though you are welcome to try newer ones, or
ones that you have patched yourself.

Version
-------
This is version 0.1 of this module, meaning it is pretty darn
new.

Demo
----
In the `com.commonsware.cwac.cache.demo` package you will find
a sample activity that demonstrates the use of `WebImageCache`.

Note that when you build the JAR via `ant jar`, the sample
activity is not included, nor any resources -- only the
compiled classes for the actual library are put into the JAR.
